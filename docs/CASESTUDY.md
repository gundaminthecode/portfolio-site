## Context

**View the full project case study here:** https://nickmathiasen.dev/portfolio-project

This project was created as a platform for me to showcase my development skills as an emerging web developer. As an aspiring developer, I wanted to create a platform to demonstrate my skills and interests to anybody interested, whether they are my peers, potential employers or somebody looking for inspiration. 

Many portfolios are created through dedicated tools to make our lives easier. Website building tools like Wix or Squarespace are used to great effect for many people. Unlike most people, I wanted to create something myself, from scratch. By creating my own portfolio, I can full customize it the way I want it, update and change it as I see fit, and if I'm feeling dangerous, start all over.

## Process

- Build
    - Scaffold React + Vite + TypeScript
    - Add routing and layout
- Polish
    - Integrate Github API
    - Optimize assets
